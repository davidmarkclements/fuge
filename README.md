## Install
To install, use npm to install globally.

```sh
npm install -g fuge
```

## Test
To run tests, use npm:

```
npm run test
```

## Usage

To generate a skeletal fuge microservice system run

```
mkdir mysystem
cd mysystem
fuge generate system
```

Fuge will create a front end site and two micro services. The directory layout is as follows:

```
├── fuge
│   └── compose-dev.yml
├── service1
├── service2
└── site
    ├── api
    └── public
```

* fuge - contains compose-dev.yml. This serves as the main control ponit for the system
* service1 - contains a basic http point to point microservice
* service2 - contains a basic http point to point microservice
* site - contains a frontend site for the system. This is comprised of an api and a public site

To execute the system run

```
fuge run ./fuge/compose-dev.yml
```

This will spin up the site and the two related microservices. Point your browser to http://localhost:10000/public/basic.html to open the front end
and exercise the microservices.

Fuge watches your code for changes and will automatically restart the front end and services as you make changes, providing a rapid development
environment for integration testing.

To generate a new service run

```
fuge generate service
```

Fuge will create a new service for you and will optionally add it into compose-dev.yml.
